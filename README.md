# üõ†Ô∏è Spring Boot REST API for LMS Batch & Program Management

This project is a Spring Boot-based RESTful API built to manage Learning Management System (LMS) entities: `tbl_lms_batch` and `tbl_lms_program`. It demonstrates full CRUD operations, entity relationships, field-level validations, and best practices in REST API development using Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA.

---

## üìö Project Requirements

1. Implement **CRUD** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) operations for:
   - `tbl_lms_batch`
   - `tbl_lms_program`

2. Identify and implement the **relationship** between these two tables (based on `LMS_DB-ER Diagram.jpg`), and develop a `GET` method to retrieve related data accordingly.

3. Include **field-level validations** for all incoming data.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate Validator
- PostgreSQL (or H2 for testing)
- Maven
- Swagger UI (for API documentation)
